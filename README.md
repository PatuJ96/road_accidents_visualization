### About Data Visualized

Data visualized is about roads accidents in 27 India states and union territories from 2003 to 2016. The data used is public and freely available from data.gov.in. The data was collected by  Transport Research Wing (TRW) of Ministry of Road Transport & Highways. The data contains year wise number of accidents reported in states.

I used the road injuries data because in last decade we have seen many development initiatives and have better motoway connectivity, but what is the cost for all this. One of the cost could have been increased road accidents but surprisingly, there has been fall in number of accidents in some states since 2003 with significant decrese between 2012 to 2013 (Delhi from 6633 to 75, following U.P. and A.P.)

Data is visualizied using line graph in chart.js and is interactive. It helps in indicating the exact number of accidents in all states each year when one points mouse over the year. The data is represented on a line graph to make it easy for the user to view rise and fall in numbers in terms of visual slopes and in an interactive manner.
